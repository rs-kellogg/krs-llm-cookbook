    "\n",
    "LLMs can replace other machine learning tasks for classification of texts. Unlike NLP models that require pre-labeled training data or a pre-defined vocabulary of words or n-grams (i.e., feature engineering), LLMs allow for zero-shot or few-shot learning to label text-like data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "1) sentiment analysis of Yelp reviews\n",
    "2) categorize customer support requests (refund, complaint, login issues, etc.)\n",
    "3) SPAM filter\n",
    "4) Hate speech or inappropriate speech detection on social media\n",
    "5) Topic identification of articles"
