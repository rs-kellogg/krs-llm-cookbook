Neural speech codec is a critical com-\\nponent of these models, which can convert speech into discrete token\\nrepresentations. However, excessive token sequences from the codec\\nmay negatively affect prediction accuracy and restrict the progres-\\nsion of Language model based TTS models. To address this issue,\\nthis paper proposes a novel neural speech codec with time-invariant\\ncodes named TiCodec. By encoding and quantizing time-invariant\\ninformation into a separate code, TiCodec can reduce the amount of\\nframe-level information that needs encoding, effectively decreasing\\nthe number of tokens as codes of speech. Furthermore, this paper\\nintroduces a time-invariant encoding consistency loss to enhance the\\nconsistency of time-invariant code within an utterance and force it\\nto capture more global information, which can benefit the zero-shot\\nTTS task. Experimental results demonstrate that TiCodec can not\\nonly enhance the quality of reconstruction speech with fewer tokens\\nbut also increase the similarity and naturalness, as well as reduce the\\nword error rate of the synthesized speech by the TTS model.\\nIndex Terms— speech codec, fewer tokens, time-invariant, lan-\\nguage model, text-to-speech\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n \"\n",
