Lions are apex predators with powerful jaws, large teeth, and muscular bodies capable of great force.\\n\\n2. **Understanding Behaviors**: My background in large cat psychology allows me to interpret the lion's body language, sounds, and movements. Iâ€™m constantly observing signs of agitation, relaxation, curiosity, or playfulness, which dictate how I interact with the animal.\\n\\n3. **Safety Measures**: Although I have a close relationship with the lions under my care, safety is always a priority. This would involve having protocols in place, such as barriers or escape routes, and never becoming complacent, no matter how well I think I understand the individual animal.\\n\\n4. **Bonding and Trust**: Building a relationship with a lion relies on trust and positive reinforcement.
